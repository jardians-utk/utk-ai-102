#### AI 102 – Natural Language-Based Programming Techniques Repository

Welcome to the official repository for **AI 102 – Natural Language-Based Programming Techniques**, a course designed specifically for students at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville

#### Course Overview

This course invites you to **explore the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence converge to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language . Through a blend of theory and hands-on programming, you’ll discover how computational methods can be used to manipulate and analyze text, unlocking the potential of human language for a wide range of applications.

#### What You’ll Learn

- **Fundamental Concepts:** Gain a solid foundation in NLP, learning how algorithms process and interpret language data in both written and spoken forms.
- **String Processing & Text Normalization:** Master essential techniques for preparing and cleaning text, including basic string operations and normalization methods.
- **Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization:** Delve into the core processes that break down text into meaningful units, reduce words to their base forms, and standardize language for further analysis.
- **Practical Applications:** Apply your skills to real-world problems such as building chatbots, performing sentiment analysis, and developing tools for language translation and summarization.

#### Why Take This Course?

As NLP continues to be one of the most widely applied areas of machine learning, the demand for professionals who can build and deploy language-based AI systems is growing rapidly . By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and practical experience needed to tackle challenges at the intersection of language and technology.
